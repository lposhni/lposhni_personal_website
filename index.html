        <p id="intro"> Hello! My name is Lena Poshni, and I am a current Sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems and Finance. I'm passionate about data science and data analytics, specifically in leveraging data to tackle real-world problems. With a strong technical background, including knowledge in Python, Java, and R, I have been able to develop a unique ability to apply these skills in real-life contexts, working on data translation, processing, and analysis to solve challenges. I am driven by the opportunity to use data to find impactful, meaningful solutions.
         In addition to my technical work, I am also deeply invested in using data to address systemic inequities. Through my research project with Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon, I‚Äôm working to close gaps in online educational videos to help patients better understand healthcare insurance. I‚Äôve extracted metadata, including subscriber count and descriptive information, from over 1,000 YouTube videos, and I'm compiling this data into CSV files. Using the data I've collected, I'll be able to create descriptive summaries to help bring attention to specific discrepancies in online videos that will ultimately optimize patients' understanding of the healthcare insurance realm.  
         I am excited to continue my journey in data science and data analytics, and I am eager to apply my skills to new and exciting projects. </p>
